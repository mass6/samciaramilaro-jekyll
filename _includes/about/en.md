👋 Hi!, I'm **Sam Ciaramilaro**, a backend software engineer based in Copenhagen, 
Denmark. I specialize in writing REST APIs in Laravel PHP, and developing web-apps using 
the TALL stack. I'm passionate about building clean code, Domain Driven 
Design, and Test Driven Development. I'm currently learning more about AWS and 
cloud infrastructure.

I currently work as a Lead Developer at **Kontainer.com**, a company providing 
the market leading Digital Asset Management system in Scandinavia. I spend the majority 
of my time working on improving our application, and extending our team's TDD 
skills. I'm currently working on implementing the next version of our JSON API.

Originally from Southern California, and relocated to Denmark in 2006. I do miss 
the weather, but I find the overall lifestyle and culture in Denmark suits me well. 
When I'm not coding, I'm usually cooking, or cleaning up the mess I just made from cooking.

🍕 Maker of pizza. 
🌮 Lover of tacos. 
🧡 Father of three wonderful children.
