ðŸ‘‹ Hi!, I'm **Sam Ciaramilaro**, a backend software engineer based in Copenhagen, Denmark. I specialize writing REST APIs in Laravel PHP. I'm passionate about building clean code, utilizing Domain Driven Design, and Test Driven Development. I'm currently learning more about AWS and cloud infrastructure.

I currently work as a Lead Developer at **Kontainer.com**, a company providing the market leading Digital Asset Management system in Scandinavia. The majority of my time is spent working on improving our platform, and extending our TDD skills. Currently working on implementing the next version of our JSON API.

Originally from Southern California, and relocated to Denmark in 2006. I do miss the weather, but I find the overall lifestyle can culture in Denmark well suits me. When I'm not coding, I'm usually cooking, or cleaning the mess I just made cooking. I make a mean Sicilian pizza. Father of three wonderful children.
